# full-stack-app-react-rest-api

    A full stack application using react and rest api.
    The Full Stack App React Rest API was created to showcase my knoledge of developing a Full Stack JavaScript application. Using a react front end client and an express server for the backend api.

    The application is a displays courses allowing users to sign up/in to an account, which allows them to create, update, or delete their own courses. Any user can view all courses without signing in. However, only the course owner has access to make updates or delete thier own course. To create a course you must be signed in.

2. Run Applications `npm start` for both /api [REST API] and /client (REACT)
3. Open localhost:3000 in browser
